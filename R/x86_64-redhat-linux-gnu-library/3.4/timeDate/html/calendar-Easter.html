<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Holidays may have two origins, ecclesiastical and public/federal. 
The ecclesiastical calendars of Christian churches are based on 
cycles of moveable and immoveable feasts. Christmas, December 25th, 
is the principal immoveable feast. Easter is the principal moveable 
feast, and dates of most other moveable feasts are determined with 
respect to Easter. 
</p>
<p>The date of Easter is evaluated by a complex procedure whose detailed 
explanation goes beyond this description. The reason that the calculation 
is so complicate is, because the date of Easter is linked to (an 
inaccurate version of) the Hebrew calendar. But nevertheless a short 
answer to the question &quot;When is Easter?&quot; is the following: Easter 
Sunday is the first Sunday after the first full moon after vernal 
equinox. For the long answer we refer to Toendering (1998).
</p>
<p>The algorithm computes the date of Easter based on the algorithm of 
Oudin (1940). It is valid for any Gregorian Calendar year.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>returns the date of Easter as an object of class <code>timeDate</code>.
